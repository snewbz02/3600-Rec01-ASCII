# 3600-Rec01-ASCII

This C program is a simple utility that prompts the user to enter an ASCII printable character and then displays its decimal, hexadecimal, and binary representations.

## Assignment Description

In this recitation assignment, we were tasked with creating a complete C program that performs the following tasks:

1. Prompt the user to enter a printable ASCII character.
2. Read the user's response and store it as an unsigned char.
3. Display the decimal and hexadecimal representations of the entered character.
4. Calculate and display the 8-bit binary representation of the character using bitwise operators.

## Sample Output

Here's an example of what the program's output may look like:

```
Enter an ASCII character: A
The ASCII value of A is:
dec -- 65
hex -- 41
bin -- 01000001
```

## Acknowledgments

- The program was created as a part of a recitation assignment in [Principles of Systems Programming/CSCE3600].
